- add some module-level doctests:
    - test MarkdownWithExtras
- Extras.wiki desc of code-color option. Not sure I love the ":::name"
  markup for the lexer name.
- allow extras attr setting on a *subclass* to be used in addition to that
  passed in with __init__
- fix test link_defn_alt_title_delims
- update MDTest 1.1? (see
  http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/2007-September/000815.html)
- extras idea: "special-patterns", e.g. mapping "bug NNN" to a moz or ko bug
  or something, etc.
- I see ref to Markdown.pl 1.0.2
  (http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/2007-August/000756.html)
  Update to that? Yes. Copy, at least, in showdown package.
- fix EOL issues with test cases (problems on Windows)
- take a look at other examples/test-cases from
  http://adlcommunity.net/help.php?file=advanced_markdown.html
- try giving reports to Yuri again (on sf.net markdown site, ask on markdown
  list)
- googlecode site: Why another Python impl? Test info. Usage/Features page.
- package up a release
- get on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown
- announce: blog, python-annoucne, markdown list
- ask about remaining two MarkdownTest test failures
- put in recipes site
- perhaps some extras from Maruku and PHP Markdown extra
  (http://maruku.rubyforge.org/maruku.html#extra)
    - tables (tho I don't really like the syntax, prefer google codes, see
      below)
    - markdown inside literal HTML (if 'markdown="1|true"' attr)
    - automatic toc generation (wanted that anyway, no a fan of maruku syntax
      for this)
    - weird markup in headers and links (does markdown2.py handle this?)
    - meta-data syntax? One example of this is ids for headers. How about
      automatically assigning header ids from the name (a la rest)?
    - at-the-top email-style headers?
    - maruku's footnote links are 'fn:1' and 'fnref:1' for a footnote id of
      'blah'. If this is the PHP Markdown Extras way, then should follow
      that.
- googlecode wiki markup ideas?
  (http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax)
    - ~~strikeout~~
    - ||tables||simple||syntax||
- <http://daringfireball.net/2004/12/markdown_licensing> at bottom has a wish
  list:
    - simple "cite" for blockquote. How about:
        [Zaphod Breeblebrox]
        > blah blah
        > blah
- do perf comparison with the other Markdown impls (if compare horribly then
  do something about it)
- submit a Markdown.py fix based on revision 1895 (on tm svn)
- see about using html5lib (for speed and/or for better raw HTML handling)
- see about plugins (SmartyPants, others available)
- perf: compare to showdown (JS markdown impl)
- perf: compare to Maruku
  (http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/2007-August/000758.html)
- add profiling info for Markdown.pl using PDK7 to the wiki perf page
