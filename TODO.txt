- add tm-cases\blog.markdown test case, I think there may be a prob with
  double <p><p> with the "What this means..." para.
- add tm-cases\extintro.markdown test case, I think there may be a prob with
  double <em>'s in <my-static-url>
- pass all test cases:
    - try to pass some of the PHPMarkdown tests (not all of them are worth
      it)
        - submit a Markdown.py fix based on revision 1895
    - try to pass the adv inline HTML MarkdownTest failure
- add equivalent "safe_mode" for compat with markdown.py
- try giving reports to Yuri again (on sf.net markdown site)
- googlecode site: Why another Python impl? Test report. Perf report.
- announce: blog, python-annoucne, markdown list
- ask about remaining two MarkdownTest test failures
- put in recipes site
- do perf comparison with the other Markdown impls (if compare horribly then
  do something about it)
- "code-safe" option
- see about using html5lib (for speed and/or for better raw HTML handling)
- see about plugins (SmartyPants, others available)
