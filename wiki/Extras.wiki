#summary Extras provided by markdown2.py
#labels Featured

This page described the extra features (additional syntax, etc.) over the core
functionality (as defined by
http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) that `markdown2.py`
provides.

These are all *off* by default and turned on as follows on the command line:

{{{
python markdown2.py --extras name1,name2 ...
}}}

and via the module interface:

{{{
>>> import markdown2
>>> html = markdown2.markdown_path(path, ..., extras=["name1", "name2"])
>>> html = markdown2.markdown("some markdown", ..., extras=["name1", "name2"])

>>> markdowner = Markdown(..., extras=["name1", "name2"])
>>> markdowner.convert("*boo!*")
<em>boo!</em>
}}}


= code-friendly =

This extra *disables* the use of leading and trailing `_` and `__` for emphasis
and strong. These can easily get in the way when writing docs about source code
with `variable_list_this` and when one is not careful about quoting.

{{{
>>> markdown2.markdown("use 'self.this_long_attr' for the *real* mccoy")
"<p>use 'self.this<em>long</em>attr' for the <em>real</em> mccoy</p>\n"
>>> markdown2.markdown("use 'self.this_long_attr' for the *real* mccoy",
...                    extras=["code-friendly"])
"<p>use 'self.this_long_attr' for the <em>real</em> mccoy</p>\n"
}}}


= footnotes =

Support for footnotes with the following syntax:

{{{
This is a paragraph with a footnote. [^note-id]

[^note-id]: This is the text of the note. 
}}}

Which produces HTML like this:

{{{
<p>This is a paragraph with a footnote. 
<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-note-id">
<a href="#fn-note-id">1</a></sup> 
</p>

...
<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn-note-id">
<p>This is the text of the note.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref-note-id" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>

<li>...for subsequent footnotes
</li>
</ol>
</div>
}}}


Notes:

* test
* a list
* here

  - TODO: It isn't clear whether the id is "fn1-1" for markdown "[^1]" or just
    "fn1".
  - I couldn't tell from the markdown-discuss discussion on footnotes whether
    John Gruber meant that the current date was added as a suffix to the anchors
    in his private Markdown.pl or whether he was literally putting in the
    "YYYY-MM-DD" strings in his markdown text.
  - Daringfireball.net (John Gruber's) site uses the "footnoteBackLink" class on
    the backref `<a>`. Also, he does *not* add the `class="footnote-ref"` on
    `<sup>` though that was mentioned here (TODO: link to discuss post about
    that).
