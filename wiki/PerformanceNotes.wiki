#summary Performance notes on Markdown implementations

The markdown2 sources have a `perf` sub-directory with some performance tools for profiling markdown2 and comparing its speed against markdown.py and Markdown.pl.

= The performance "suites"

There are two sets of "suites" (sets of .text files to convert) that I've been using for testing. One is a copy of all the test cases from the `test` dir (see [TestingNotes]). The second is a .text file for every description and comment in the Python Cookbook (I've been playing with a refreshment of the Python XXX.
To generate some performance suites run:

{{{
cd perf
python gen_perf_cases.py
}}}
