#summary The "cuddled-lists" extra

This extra allows a list to be cuddled to a preceding paragraph. (Normally a blank line is necessary between a leading paragraph and a bulleted list.) For example, with this extra, this text:

{{{
I did these things:
* bullet1
* bullet2
* bullet3
}}}

becomes this:

{{{
<p>I did these things:</p>

<ul>
<li>bullet1</li>
<li>bullet2</li>
<li>bullet3</li>
</ul>
}}}

instead of the normal:

{{{
<p>I did these things:
* bullet1
* bullet2
* bullet3</p>
}}}

Example usage:

{{{
>>> markdown2.markdown(text, extras=["cuddled-lists"])
}}}

{{{
$ python markdown2.py -x cuddled-lists FOO.txt
}}}
