#summary What another Python Markdown implementation?

There is already a [http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/Features Python markdown implementation]. So why write another one?

  * I've run into some issues with `markdown.py`, some of which looked like fixing might be quite difficult. My initial attempts to email the maintainer ended up bouncing. At that point I started looking into a re-write. I've noticed now that `markdown.py` is [http://sourceforge.net/projects/python-markdown/ hosted on SourceForge]. (TODO: create issues there and link to them here.)

  * TODO: mention the safe_mode thing and recent HTML sanitization discussions

  * For fun. Who doesn't like writing parsing code. :)
