# python-markdown2 Changelog

## python-markdown2 v1.0.1.1

- Added "footnotes" extra: adds support for footnotes syntax. See
  <http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras> for details.

## python-markdown2 v1.0.1.0

- Added "code-friendly" extra: disables the use of leading and trailing '_'
  and '__' for emphasis and strong. These can easily get in the way when
  writing docs about source code with variable_list_this and when one is not
  careful about quoting.
- Full basic Markdown syntax.


(Started maintaining this log 15 Oct 2007. At that point there had been no
releases of python-markdown2.)
