# python-markdown2 Changelog

## python-markdown2 v1.0.1.2

- [Issue 8, **incompatible change**] The "-s|--safe" command line option and
  the equivalent "safe_mode" option has changed semantics to be a string
  instead of a boolean. Legal values of the string are "replace" (the old
  behaviour: literal HTML is replaced with "[HTML_REMOVED]") and "escape"
  (meta chars in literal HTML is escaped).
- [Issue 11] Process markup in footnote definition bodies.
- Add support for `-*- markdown-extras: ... -*-` emacs-style local variables
  (typically in an XML comment) to set "extras" for the markdown conversion.
- [Issue 6] Fix problem with footnotes if the reference string had uppercase
  letters.

## python-markdown2 v1.0.1.1

- [Issue 3] Fix conversion of unicode strings.
- Make the "safe_mode" replacement test overridable via subclassing: change
  `Markdown.html_removed_text`.
- [Issue 2] Fix problems with "safe_mode" removing generated HTML, instead of
  just raw HTML in the text.
- Add "-s|--safe" command-line option to set "safe_mode" conversion
  boolean. This option is mainly for compat with markdown.py.
- Add "link-patterns" extra: allows one to specify a list of regexes that
  should be automatically made into links. For example, one can define a
  mapping for things like "Mozilla Bug 1234":
        regex:  mozilla\s+bug\s+(\d+)
        href:   http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=\1
  See <http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras> for details.
- Add a "MarkdownWithExtras" class that enables all extras (except
  "code-friendly"):
    >>> import markdown2
    >>> converter = markdown2.MarkdownWithExtras()
    >>> converter.convert('...TEXT...')
    ...HTML...
- [Issue 1] Added "code-color" extra: pygments-based (TODO: link) syntax
  coloring of code blocks. Requires the pygments Python library on sys.path.
  See <http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras> for details.
- [Issue 1] Added "footnotes" extra: adds support for footnotes syntax. See
  <http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras> for details.

## python-markdown2 v1.0.1.0

- Added "code-friendly" extra: disables the use of leading and trailing '_'
  and '__' for emphasis and strong. These can easily get in the way when
  writing docs about source code with variable_list_this and when one is not
  careful about quoting.
- Full basic Markdown syntax.
