# python-markdown2 Changelog

## python-markdown2 v1.0.1.1

- Add a "MarkdownWithExtras" class that enables all extras (except
  "code-friendly"):
    >>> import markdown2
    >>> converter = markdown2.MarkdownWithExtras()
    >>> converter.convert('...TEXT...')
    ...HTML...
- [Issue 1] Added "code-color" extra: pygments-based (TODO: link) syntax
  coloring of code blocks. Requires the pygments Python library on sys.path.
  See <http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras> for details.
- [Issue 1] Added "footnotes" extra: adds support for footnotes syntax. See
  <http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras> for details.

## python-markdown2 v1.0.1.0

- Added "code-friendly" extra: disables the use of leading and trailing '_'
  and '__' for emphasis and strong. These can easily get in the way when
  writing docs about source code with variable_list_this and when one is not
  careful about quoting.
- Full basic Markdown syntax.
