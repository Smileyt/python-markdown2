- try giving reports to Yuri again (on sf.net markdown site, ask on markdown
  list)
- googlecode site: Why another Python impl? Test report. Perf report.
- package up a release
- announce: blog, python-annoucne, markdown list
- ask about remaining two MarkdownTest test failures
- put in recipes site
- do perf comparison with the other Markdown impls (if compare horribly then
  do something about it)
- submit a Markdown.py fix based on revision 1895 (on tm svn)
- see about using html5lib (for speed and/or for better raw HTML handling)
- see about plugins (SmartyPants, others available)
